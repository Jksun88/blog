Today 09/12/22 I am starting to learn JS with coderslang.

Here I will write my remarks and track my progress. I may be writing in french too. The first lesson is about setting the goal and the good behavior to be able to follow through till the end of the course. The key point to keep in mind are :

1- set a schedule

2- eliminate distraction

3- track your progress

4- practice and practice

The first mission is to set up our environment. We will use [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit our code and run it. We will install the coderslang vscode plugin, to have just search it in the plugins. We already register an account on coderslang.

Variables

To output or display something on the screen we are going to use

console.log('Our line on the screen');

To declare a variable we are going to use the keyword **let** \=&gt; let dateOfBirth

Programmers use the camelCase to name variable.

Variables that remain the same or are much likely to not change during the whole program are constant. We declare them with the keyword **const =&gt;** const numberOfDays;
