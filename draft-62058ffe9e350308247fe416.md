There are three levels of deletion in sql. 
You can either 


1. Delete a database 
```DROP DATABASE db_name;
```

2. Delete a table in a database
```DROP TABLE tables_name;  
``` 
You have to be connected on the database where the table you want to delete is. 
> You can't really turn off(press the switch button) the light from a room you are not into :)

3. Delete a row in a table 
```DELETE FROM tables_name WHERE condition ; 
```

To update a the values of a row your can do 
```UPDATE table_name SET column_name=value WHERE condition;
```


**Bonus:** To rename a database you will have to alter the database
```ALTER DATABASE db_name RENAME TO new_db_name ; 
```
